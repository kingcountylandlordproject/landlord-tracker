# landlord-tracker

Hi! to set up the landlord-tracker postgres you should just have to 

*   unzip the datafile into a ./data/raw directory
*   run install_tracker.sh in this directory. 

However, this may not work on the first try so if you enconter any bugs during the process, please message thomas.da.paine on slack or in the signal to fix the problems you encounter. Thanks!


------------ Now some Notes! ----------------

- to log into postgres, run: landlord-tracker/landlord_tracker/engles/scripts/login_to_postgres.sh

- note, if you reinstall this, cleaned data .csv will be wiped out --- you have been warned!
